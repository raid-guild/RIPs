# RG Styleguide


## Delivered

Designs have been harmonized in Figma, implemented into Chakra components and are viewable via the Storybook page connected to the repo.

- [Storybook](https://raid-guild.github.io/design-system/)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/sJTweh3sRIpX2yaQD4E8zK/Raidguild-Styleguide?node-id=0%3A1)
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/raid-guild/design-system)

There a still a lot of components in the Figma under 'To audit', which could be presented during cohorts for onboarding and cooperating with RG apprentices.

### Why should we build this

As we have an expanding set of products it's efficient to harmonize and centralize all the styling efforts done in multiple repositories. This way, we build a uniform housestyle so products can easily express the RG feel. Adrienne has a nice set-up for structuring a Figma which delivers a Figma library so the design cycle can be sped up as well. Additionally, when these can be translated to ready made components it speeds up the development cycle.

### Anything else you'd like to add?

Efforts have already been done in the rip-styleguide channel. However it is not complete and we would like to have it be complete so we are ready for a cohort (season 3?) to build components based on the styleguide.

Most time and complexity will be aggregating, organizing and creating the styling in Figma.

For more information/history see the #rip-styleguide channel.
