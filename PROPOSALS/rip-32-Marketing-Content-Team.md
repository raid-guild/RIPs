# Project Idea
Case studies for 3-4 Raid Guild projects. This will entail two meetings with RaidGuild teams to identify success stories/testimonials/cross promotion and follow up with a review + statistics. Two meetings with clients for initial results and a follow up.

We’ll create pieces on two topics in twitter threads, on our blog, and a youtube video (if we have one). The first topic would be highlighting the technical process of completing this project from start to finish. The second topic would be highlighting the impact/benefits of the client. 
The objective of this project is to establish RaidGuild as the top-of-mind choice for people seeking project support, ensuring that our name naturally springs to their thoughts without the necessity for further research.
We also want to make a retrospective on this project itself. This will be an internal only breakdown of the current/projected long term ROI on this project.

## Summary
This RIP is to demonstrate RaidGuild's past projects in Web3 development by sharing detailed insights into completed projects. This includes emphasizing project goals, team contributions, challenges faced, and innovative solutions, possibly through Twitter Threads.
Additionally, the initiative seeks to include client testimonials or brief success stories to validate RaidGuild's capabilities and showcase client satisfaction. Visual elements like graphics or snippets will be used to highlight key project aspects, making them visually appealing and easy to understand. Before-and-after visuals or progress snapshots can be included to demonstrate the impact of RaidGuild's work in transforming projects.
To measure the success of these efforts, we will include tracking engagement metrics like likes, comments, shares, and retweets, evaluating conversion rates from profile visits to inquiries with support of the B2B Team (Suede, coffee-crusher) and the newly integrated analytics on the RaidGuild's website. 

## Project Showcases:
* Sharing detailed breakdowns of past projects
* Highlighting the goal,s team involvement, challenges faced, and innovative solutions provided (e.g., in a Twitter Thread)
* Success stories with client testimonials or brief statements about their satisfaction.
* We are starting this with Sero and Sasquatch’s project. We also want to ask clients how they found RaidGuild
* Include visually appealing graphics or snippets showcasing key aspects of completed projects, maybe using before-and-after visuals or progress snapshots to demonstrate the impact of the DAO's work
* We’ll develop KPIs to measure success of each case study
  * Pupcakes reached out to Sero and Sasquatch for their project details 
* Call to Action (“Hire us!” or similar) will be included at the end of the Thread to generate more traffic to RaidGuild’s website and eventually turn into business inquiries. 
* Behind-the-Scenes Insights. Offer glimpses into the DAO's internal processes, team culture, or the way projects are managed to build trust.

## Why should we build this?
Our initiative is aimed to enhance RaidGuild’s visibility and credibility as one of the leading DAO in Web3 development. By increasing our presence on social media platforms like Twitter, we aim to increase traffic to the website, particularly to the “Hire Us” CTA, ultimately attracting more clients and strengthening RaidGuild’s reputation in the industry.
Our counterparts are going to submit a RIP in December to do cold outreach sales. We want to support this effort with content that will help close the deals (real numbers on how we’ve impressed past clients). 

## Bonus work, Video Content:
* Recycle the 'brown bag' workshops by summarizing key takeaways, possibly with a quote on graphic → then post a link to the recording
share snippets or teasers of these videos on Twitter to generate interest and direct traffic to the full content on YouTube
* create YouTube channel
* convert Origin Stories to video and social media content

### Cost: 
* 2x youtube video - 12 hours each. 24hrs x $50/hr = $1200

## Cost (in USD)
**Total: $2.3K per case study**
* Planning - 4 hours
* 4x meetings - 2 hour each
* 2x A twitter thread - 6 hours each
* 2x blog posts - 6 hours each
* 1x retrospective - 10 hours
* 46hrs at 50/hr = 2.3k

## Timeline
December 11 - January 31 for one case study
