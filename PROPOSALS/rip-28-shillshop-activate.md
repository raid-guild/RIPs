# ShillShop RIP: Operation Activate 
**Purpose**: Blockchain projects have specific marketing demands. They need to explain complicated technical concepts to their userbase in simple-to-understand terms, and often the language needed to do it hasn't even been created yet.

ShillShop is a collection of skilled marketing Raiders who are experts in blockchain technology. They are ready and able to execute all different types of marketing raids, including one-off projects like website design or strategy, as well as ongoing campaigns like social media and email marketing. 

**In short, the members of ShillShop have the skills, and now it's time to bring a little order to the House, and create an outreach strategy to find more clients (including marketing clients) for Raid Guild.**

## Specifically, ShillShop proposes to do this:
- **Develop a responsive, Shill Shop landing page that describes what we do, and the process by which we do it.**
    - Wireframe, design, copy, develop, including images and other assets.
    - This would be a subpage of RaidGuild.org
- **Create Consultation Funnel for new marketing clients.**
    - What are the steps from client interest to end of marketing raid?
    - Create marketing specific consult application.
    - Create one-off engagement contract and parameters.
    - Create ongoing engagement contract and parameters.

- **Create menu of offerings as well as general fee structure for each.**
- **Create Raid Guild ongoing marketing plan. Raid Guild has a ton of success stories that should be shared. It's our best advertisement. But on top of that:**
    - Newsletter / Email
    - Social Media
    - Blog

- **Create benchmarking and reporting system for clients (and Raid Guild) that answers the question: "How do we know what we're doing is working?**"

The members of ShillShop propose to execute the above within 30 days of approval. We kindly ask for $5000 to make it happen. 

**Thank you!**
